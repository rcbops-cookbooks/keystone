Description
===========

This cookbook installs the OpenStack Identity Service (codename: keystone) from packages, creating default user, tenant, and roles. It also registers the identity service and identity endpoint.

http://keystone.openstack.org/

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use)

Platform
--------

* CentOS >= 6.3
* Ubuntu >= 12.04

Cookbooks
---------

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* database
* mysql
* openssl
* osops-utils

LDAP Support
=============
Begininng with the folsom version of the cookbooks we have added support for using LDAP as a keystone backend. In order to enable this functionality the following attributes must be set, in your chef environment, to match your ldap schema.

Base Configuration
-----------
Every possible ldap config option is now an attribute. All attributes are set to empty strings in the attributes file
the template loops through ldap attributes and puts set attributes into keystone.conf. The following is exerpt from a working environment configuration (ip and password have been redacted).
    "keystone": {
      "ldap": {
        "user_attribute_ignore": "tenantId",
        "tenant_tree_dn": "ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com",
        "role_tree_dn": "ou=Roles,dc=example,dc=com",
        "tenant_attribute_ignore": "tenantId",
        "group_attribute_ignore": "enabled",
        "url": "ldap://*.*.*.*",
        "tenant_objectclass": "groupOfNames",
        "tenant_enabled_emulation": "True",
        "use_dumb_member": "True",

      },
      "auth_type": "ldap",
      "debug": "True"
    }


User Configuration
-----------

* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["user_tree_dn"] = ""

* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["user_id_attribute"] = "cn"
    - the user id attribute for users created by keystone.Should match common ldap schema, cn by default.
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["user_name_attribute"] = "sn"
    - the user name attribute for users created by keystone. Should match common ldap schema, sn by default.

    - the objectclass for roles created by keystone. Should match common ldap schema, organizationalRole by default.
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["role_id_attribute"] = "cn"
    - the role id attribute for roles created by keystone. Should match common ldap schema, cn by default.
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["role_member_attribute"] = "roleOccupant"
    - the attribute for a member of a role. Should match common ldap schema, roleOccupant by default.

Tenant Configuration
---------------------------
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["tenant_tree_dn"] = ""
    - the distinguished name of the tenant tree (e.g. ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com)
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["tenant_objectclass"] = "groupOfNames"
    - the objectclass for the tenants created by keystone. Should match common ldap schema, groupOfNames by default.
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["tenant_id_attribute"] = "cn"
    - the tenant id attribute for tenants created by keystone. Should match common ldap schema, cn by default.
* default["keystone"]["ldap"]["tenant_member_attribute"] = "member"
    - the tenant member attribute for tenants created by keystone. Should match common ldap schema, member by default.
